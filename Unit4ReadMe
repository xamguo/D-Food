Coding progress
1. Database design and creation.
We create our own data to store the information which includes the customer info, delivery
man info, restaurant lists and the dish lists.
2. Server
We have our own server to handle the request from the app user. Whenever the user search,
choose a restaurant, the server will accept the request and extract the data from the database
and return the results back to the user.
3. GoogleMap route
We are going to display the route on which the delivery man will drive to deliver the food on the
screen. User will be able to see and track the actual location of the delivery man.
4. UI
New UI design was implemented to make it more beautiful and user friendly.
